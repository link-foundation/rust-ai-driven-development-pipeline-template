### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.
