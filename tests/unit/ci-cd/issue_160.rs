//! Regression tests for issues #160, #165 and #166.
//!
//! - #160: actionlint 1.7.7 false-positived on real hosted runner labels and
//!   missed the newer glob checks; the pin moved to 1.7.12 and the label
//!   allowlist went away (covered with #141's tests).
//! - #165: the `unpinned-images` audit is Pedantic-persona only, so a
//!   `uses: docker://image:tag` reference never reached the `'*': hash-pin`
//!   policy. The image is digest-pinned and a narrow pedantic pass enforces
//!   the policy going forward.
//! - #166: zizmor-action@v0.6.2's `latest` is frozen at zizmor 1.29.0, while
//!   the job's own comment told users to reproduce with `zizmor==1.30.0`, a
//!   version the action cannot install. The version input is now named and
//!   the documentation matches it.
