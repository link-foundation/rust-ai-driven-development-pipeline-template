//! Regression tests for issue #150.
//!
//! `scripts/*.rs` carries 78 `#[test]` functions across nine rust-scripts, and
//! no workflow ran a single one of them. `cargo test` only builds the library
//! crate, so the release-script regression guards -- including the
//! rebase-before-stage ordering check in `version-and-commit.rs`, which exists
//! because a release once died with "cannot rebase: Your index contains
//! uncommitted changes" -- had never executed in CI.
//!
//! Two suites had rotted unnoticed as a direct consequence:
//!
//! * `create-github-release.rs` did not compile in test mode. It declared its
//!   `release_naming` module only under `#[cfg(not(test))]` and substituted
//!   `use super::release_naming`, a path that resolves to nothing when
//!   `rust-script --test` builds the file as its own crate root.
//! * `version-and-commit.rs` and `wait-for-crate.rs` failed under the
//!   workflow-level `RUSTFLAGS: -Dwarnings`, because a test harness has no
//!   `main`, so every helper reachable only from `main` is reported unused.
//!
//! These tests pin the fixes and the workflow step that would have caught them.
