//! Regression tests for issue #141.
//!
//! The multi-architecture manifest step built its digest list with a
//! single-quoted `printf` format, so `${DOCKERHUB_IMAGE}` was passed through
//! literally and `docker buildx imagetools create` received an invalid image
//! reference. `shellcheck` reports it as SC2016, but no workflow ran
//! `actionlint`, so the defect was never surfaced.
