//! Regression tests for issue #149.
//!
//! `release.yml` declared the crates.io credentials in the workflow-level
//! `env:` block. That block is inherited by *every* job in the workflow,
//! including the `pull_request` jobs that compile and run code from the branch
//! under review (`build.rs`, procedural macros, the tests themselves). A
//! one-line `build.rs` in a branch pull request could therefore read the
//! publish token out of its own environment.
//!
//! Only two steps need the credentials, and both declare them at step level.
//! These tests pin the invariant in both directions: no workflow-level `env:`
//! value anywhere under `.github/workflows` may reference `secrets.`, and the
//! two publish steps must still receive the tokens.
