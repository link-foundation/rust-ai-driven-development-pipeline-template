# Validate the repository's key documentation (issue #161).
#
# CI-CD-BEST-PRACTICES principle 12 asks for three checks on documentation:
# size limits (scripts/check-file-size.rs), broken links (.github/workflows/
# links.yml), and "the documents that are supposed to exist carry the sections
# other documents link to". This script is the third check: a diff review
# reliably misses a deleted CONTRIBUTING.md or a gutted README, and the link
# checker actually gets greener when the sections that contained the links go
# away.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-required-docs.sh          # run the check
#   bash scripts/check-required-docs.sh --list   # print `path<TAB>section`
#
# --list prints the requirement table itself, so tests (and anyone extending
# the table) build fixtures from the same source the check reads instead of
# restating it and drifting from it.
