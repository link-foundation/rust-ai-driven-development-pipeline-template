# Unit test / reproduction for the issue #69 buildx-boot resilience hardening in
# .github/actions/setup-buildx-resilient/action.yml.
#
# Root cause (issue #69): release.yml booted buildx with
# docker/setup-buildx-action and no pinned-image pre-pull. The default
# docker-container driver makes dockerd pull moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1 from
# Docker Hub at boot. When registry-1.docker.io has a transient outage, that
# boot pull fails and takes the whole publish job down even though nothing is
# wrong with the code or the build.
#
# The fix pre-pulls the pinned BuildKit image with retries and adds a
# pull-through registry-mirror fallback (mirror.gcr.io) plus a re-tag to the
# canonical reference, so a full Docker Hub outage no longer fails the boot.
# This test extracts the real pre-pull script out of action.yml and drives it
# with a mock `docker` that can independently fail the canonical registry
# and/or the mirror, asserting the recovery behaviour for every case.
